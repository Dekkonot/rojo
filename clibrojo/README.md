# Rojo as a C Library
This is an experiment to expose a C API for Rojo that would be suitable for embedding it into an existing C/C++ application.

I'm hoping to expand it to drop the HTTP layer and communicate through a channel, which could make it feasible to embed into an existing Roblox IDE with minimal changes or additional code.
